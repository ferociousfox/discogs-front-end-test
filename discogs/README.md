# Welcome!
 
This project was bootstrapped with CRA. I did my best with the time given and have left notes on what I would have
improved on, given more time.

## To serve App:
### cd into the discogs directory and run `yarn start`

## You can run the tests from the same directory by running `yarn jest`

### Notes on improvements 

~ React implementation, I could shore up performance just a bit, now the sort functions are running
  on every render. I think I should have gone the useCallback route. Also, memoizing the incoming data would be 
  necessary for a production instance.
~ CSS, the Card details could be cleaner and the grid could look better when it is reduced down to one column.
~ Accessability, I am newer to this and it was really cool to explore. I would have liked to get an 
  onPressEnter working when focused on the individual cards. I did my best here and am excited about making apps 
  more accessable.
~ Testing, I think there is almost always room for more here and just didn't have enough time to write a 
  comprehensive suite. 

Thank you so much for your consideration. I would love to be a member of the discogs team and hope this sample of 
my work looks good to y'all. Have a good one.
